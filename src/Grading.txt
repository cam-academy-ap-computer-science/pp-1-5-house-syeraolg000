Good work!

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the set of
methods that did the verses, and a comment for the set of
methods that did the individual lines within the verses.
You want your comments to help show the structure of your code.

You used a capital letter at the beginning of the House()
method, and lowercase letters at the beginning of all the other
methods.  It will be really important to have a consistent
way of naming your variables and methods.  I took off one point
for that.

Your program is as efficient as it can be.  Well done!
